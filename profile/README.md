We are aspiring full stack web developers, studying through Coder Academy! Our journey is only just beginning, and this organisation was created as part of our term long MERN stack application assessment.  
This involved three separate assessments for:
1. Planning and Design
2. Backend API - Node.js, Express, Mongoose & MongoDB
3. Frontend API - React, Vite, lots of other goodies!

We are:

Joss - Pop culture addict, keen boulderer, retail extraordinaire!
Jordan - Gym and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu guy, loves testing!
Nhi - Is the styling queen, also will give you lashes that slay!
